[Cemre](http://cemresuler.nl) and I had to make a project for English, so we made a game where you have to read a text and answer some questions. Of course it's open source, this time available The Unlicense. So you can do whatever you want with the stuff. To play the game you need to have a windows computer or you need to have Unity (5.4.0) installed. The game was originally made for iPad, so you can also build it for iOS. I cannot guarantee that it will work, so it may need some debugging.

## Download
