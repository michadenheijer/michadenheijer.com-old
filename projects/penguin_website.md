title: "Penguin website"

I made a website for school, using HTML5, CSS and JS. I've made and designed a website about pinguins in Dutch. It's (again) open source, available under the CC 4.0. Of course you can use the design and change the text, but you just need to give credit. I have made it a long time ago, so there may be some copyright problems. If I do, please contact me to solve the problem. If there are any problems or the website doesn't work, please contact me and maybe I can help, but no guarentees. There's no additional software required, but for hosting Apache or Nginx is needed.
