As a computer science project I and the gang of CSM-devs had to make an ARgame. Is made using [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) and [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) (2017.4.0 and up). We've made an installation guide and it's of course available at GitHub. Also we've made a build for Xcode so you can easily install it on your iPhone (iOS 11.0 or higher) or iPad (also iOS 11.0 or higher). It's available under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). If needed, then please contact us, then we can figure out if a other licensing agreement is possible.

The game is not very optimized and it will probably not work very well, it's just a project to show our teacher how to create AR-games, and it's very easy, so if you want to make a AR-game yourself, just google a tutorial and it'll be easy to figure it out.
