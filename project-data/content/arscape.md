As a computer science project I and the gang of CSM-devs had to make an ARgame. Is made using [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) and [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) (2017.4.0 and up). We've made an installation guide and it's of course available at GitHub. Also we've made a build for Xcode so you can easily install it on your iPhone (iOS 11.0 or higher) or iPad (also iOS 11.0 or higher). It's available under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). If needed, then please contact us, then we can figure out if a other licensing agreement is possible.

## Download
There are serveral methods to install the project.
### Using Xcode files
First download the project by downloading this [.zip](https://github.com/CSMdevs/ARscapeRoom/releases/download/v1.0-alpha-1/BuildForXcode-v1.0-alpha1.zip) file and follow [the instructions](https://github.com/CSMdevs/ARscapeRoom/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha-1).

### Source
You can easily download the files by using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/CSMdevs/EscapeRoom.git
```
To build it you need Unity 2017.3.0, there are also [install instructions](https://github.com/CSMdevs/ARscaperoom#method-1-build-yourself-with-unity-and-xcode)
