I've made my own smart mirror. I've used the GitHub project [MagicMirror](http://magicmirror.builders), to build the mirror, I've used a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), a generic screen,  two-way-mirror and some wood. It's very easy, and most people can do this. It uses [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which is very easy to install.
