I've made my own smarthome, I've used several open source projects like [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io), [Homebridge](http://homebridge.io/) and [MagicMirror](http://magicmirror.builders). You can find [my Home Assistant config](http://github.com/michadenheijer/home-assistant-config). The control system looks something like this:

I'm also making a Smart Mirror, which will be able to tell which lights are on and who are home, but that's another project. There are a lot of components in this smart home and it's easy to edit.
