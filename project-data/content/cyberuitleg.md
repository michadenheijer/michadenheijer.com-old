CyberUitleg is a website created by [CSMdevs](http://csmdevs.github.io) (which I'm part of), to teach 1 vwo (high school) students more about encrytion and other cyber related stuff. It's very interactive, because it uses videos, animations and quizzes. Because it has interactive content, the students will very quickly. At the moment it's still in beta and it's not finished yet, but more content will be added soon. You can visit the [beta](http://www.cyberuitleg.nl). You cannot download the files since it's closed source, it might become open source in the furture, but it's not planned to become open source.
